      This table contains non-statistical information about NBA teams per season
      from 1946 - 2023, including their founding year and location details. This
      teams data is current, meaning that only the team's current city and state
      is available.  Example: There's no team called 'Seattle Supersonics'. 
      Instead, that team is called 'Oklahoma City Thunder' because that's where
      the team (indicated by the team_id) currently resides.

      This data set comes from the official NBA api. You can learn more here.

    description: >-
      This table provides season-by-season statistical data for NBA teams from
      1946 - 2023, including their performance and various game stats. When
      examining the data, you'll notice instances where team_city and/or
      team_name occasionally change, but the team_id remains consistent.  This
      is because teams some team move cities and/or change their names. Example:
      The "Seattle Supersonics" turned into the "Oklahoma City Thunder", but he
      team_id is the same.
