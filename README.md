## Introduction
Explore my project for the _dbtâ„¢ data modeling challenge - NBA Edition_. Hosted by [Paradime](https://www.paradime.io/), this project dives into the analysis and visualization of NBA statistics, designed for basketball fans and analysts.

## Data Sources
My analysis leverages three key NBA datasets from Paradime:
- *PLAYER_GAME_LOGS*
- *TEAM_STATS_BY_SEASON*
- *COMMON_PLAYER_INFO*

## Methodology
### Tools Used
- **[Paradime](https://www.paradime.io/)** for SQL, dbtâ„¢, and CSV exports.
- **[Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/)** for data storage and computing.
- **Google Sheets** for data visualization.

### Applied Techniques
- SQL and dbtâ„¢ to transform _stg_player_game_logs_ into seasonal player statistics
- SQL and dbtâ„¢ to transform _stg_player_game_logs_ and _stg_common_player_info_ to understand
  playoff and regular season performance by individual players
- SQL and dbtâ„¢ to transform _stg_common_player_info_ for insights on NBA players' college backgrounds.
- SQL and dbtâ„¢ transform _stg_team_stats_by_season_ for insights into team playoff appearances.

## Visualizations
### Team Playoff Appearances
Visualization of playoff appearances for all 30 NBA teams, including their playoff appearance rates.
